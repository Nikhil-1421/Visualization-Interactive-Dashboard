# Visualization-Interactive-Dashboard
### The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of my Interactive Dashboarding capabilities


#### First I used Kaggle to create a dataframe that displayed all of Lewis Hamilton's Qualifying performances throughout his career. This can be found in Creating Dataframe to be Visualized.ipynb


#### Next I used a local Jupyter Notebook to perform some Data Wrangling, and launch my dash app within Lewis Quali FINAL.ipynb

#### Because the dashboard I created can only be viewed on a local server, I have uploaded a video of the interactive dashboard in use
